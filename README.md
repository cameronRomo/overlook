## Project Overview
This was a Mod 2 solo project assigned at the end of the mod. The primary function of the site is to implement logic that could be used in a real world hotel booking website. There is full functionality for a user to view their booked rooms, add a room for booking, and search rooms entering either a date and/or room type. As a manager the logic gets a little more complicated. Upon logging-in the manager will be able to select a specific user, view and/or delete their bookings, search rooms by date and/or type and book. This project was our cohort's second attempt at using API calls to retrieve data, post data, or delete it. This relatively new concept was a great opportunity to reach some milestones, and will be discussed further down in this README. Thank you for your time in reviewing this project.

## Goals
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and other's can understand it
* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve, post, or delete data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure the app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline the workflow process
* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that API requests are working
* Work with a PR buddy to establish a good workflow and review each-other's code
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Challenges
* Utilizing GitHub Project board to organize work
* Using class inheritance
* New SASS syntax
* Using Chai Spies to test API calls
* Time management and project planning

## Wins
* Success with atomic commits
* Good planning up front
* Using GitHub issues in conjunction with GH project board to organize work-flow
* Successful with self-teaching new tools
* Successfully testing with spies
* Using SASS to dry up my CSS
* Validating user login and mediating the exchange of data between a customer and a manager

## Roadmap
* With more time, I would like improve the UI and UX for a better user experience
* Add the ability to create a new customer
* Add more sad path testing
* Better display data for toggling between rooms and bookings displays
* Add more fun and references to my favorite movie "The Grand Budapest Hotel"
